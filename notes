# Random notes so I don't forget what I did

Libraries written in C don't compile unless you 
wrap the function declerations in the header 
the following way:
    #ifdef __cplusplus
    extern "C" {
    #endif

    void foo();

    #ifdef __cplusplus
    }
    #endif
You can also just change the library script to a .cpp extension.
